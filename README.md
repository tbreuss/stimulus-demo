# Stimulus Demo

[Stimulus][stimulus] (by [Basecamp][basecamp]) is a modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have.

This demo was made to show Stimulus-based controllers that get connected to and disconnected from elements as they're added or removed from the DOM.
 
## Usage

To run the demo you have to start a webserver at the root of this repository.

    # Start the built-in PHP server:        
    $ php -S localhost:9999

Then, open <http://localhost:9999> in your browser.

I hope it's useful!
