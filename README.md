# Stimulus.js Demo

[Stimulus][stimulus] (by [Basecamp][basecamp]) is a modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have.

This demo was made to show Stimulus-based controllers, actions and targets.
As a proof of concept it implements a rough controller which places server-side rendered markup into DOM.
Think of Stimulus without the need of [Turbolinks][turbolinks].
As a result this demo feels like a single-page application (SPA) even though it is in fact a multi page application (MPA). 

Hope it's useful!

## Usage

Run the demo by starting a webserver in your project folder.

    # Start the built-in PHP server
    $ php -S localhost:9999

Then, open <http://localhost:9999> in your browser.
