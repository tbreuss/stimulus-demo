<p class="lead"><strong><a href="https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus" target="_blank">Stimulus</a> is a new Javascript framework thatâ€™s been published this year (2018) by the guys behind <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>.</strong></p>

<p>
    This demo was made to show Stimulus-based controllers, actions and targets.
    As proof of concept it implements a rough controller which places server-side rendered markup into DOM.
    As a result this demo feels like a single-page application (SPA) even though it is in fact a multi page application (MPA).
    Think of Stimulus without the need of <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks" target="_blank">Turbolinks</a>.

<p>Sidenote: This demo is consuming data from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" target="_blank">JSONPlaceholder</a> a fake online REST API.</p>
